# Problem_2 Question: Write a function named my_len() which receives a string as a parameter and then counts the length of that string and returns that count. Donâ€™t use strlen() function to get the length of the string. After receiving that count in the main function print it. Note : The string will not have any spaces.

""" 
sample input        output
hello               5
"""


# Function to calculate the length of a string
def my_len(s):
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        count += 1
    return count

s = input()         # Input string
length = my_len(s)  # Calculate and print the length

print(length)
